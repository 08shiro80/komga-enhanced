## [0.1.3.1] - 2026-03-31 Hotfix

### Bug Fixes
- **MangaDex rate limiter caused 51s waits** — The per-minute limit (40 req/min) was far too restrictive for MangaDex's actual 5 req/sec limit. After ~40 requests (~8 seconds), the rate limiter would calculate a ~51 second wait. Removed the per-minute limit entirely; only the 5 req/sec limit remains.
- **429 retry handler added phantom timestamps** — When a 429 response was received, the retry logic called `rateLimiter.waitIfNeeded()` again, which recorded a phantom request timestamp and could trigger the per-minute limit. Removed the redundant `waitIfNeeded()` call from all three 429 handlers.
- **Two independent MangaDex rate limiters** — `MangaDexClient` and `MangaDexApiClient` each had their own rate limiting. Requests from both counted against MangaDex's IP-based limit but neither knew about the other. Merged into a single `MangaDexApiClient` with one shared `MangaDexRateLimiter`.

### Improved
- **Logs page defaults to live view** — The server logs page now auto-starts the live stream on load instead of requiring a manual click on the "Live" button.

| Modified/New Files | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `infrastructure/download/MangaDexRateLimiter.kt` | Removed per-minute limit, simplified to 5 req/sec only |
| `infrastructure/download/MangaDexApiClient.kt` | Removed phantom `waitIfNeeded()` from 429 handlers, added `searchManga()` |
| `interfaces/api/rest/ChapterUrlController.kt` | Switched from `MangaDexClient` to `MangaDexApiClient` |
| `interfaces/api/rest/HealthCheckController.kt` | Switched from `MangaDexClient` to `MangaDexApiClient` |
| `infrastructure/mangadex/MangaDexClient.kt` | **Deleted** — consolidated into `MangaDexApiClient` |
| `komga-webui/src/views/LogsView.vue` | Auto-start live stream on mount |

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-27

### Bug Fixes
- **Documentation fixes** — Fixed incorrect API reference and README. Fixed Docker gallery-dl update command (`-u 0`, `pip3`, `--break-system-packages`). Removed inline API snippets from README (api-reference.md is the single source).

### Changed
- **Merged `/follow-config` into `/scheduler`** — Removed separate `/api/v1/downloads/follow-config` endpoint. All scheduler settings are now managed via `/api/v1/downloads/scheduler`. Removed `urls` field from scheduler (URLs are managed per-library via `follow-txt`). Check-now moved to `POST /scheduler/check-now`.
- **UNIQUE constraint on mangaDexUuid** — `DownloadExecutor` crashed with `UNIQUE constraint failed: SERIES.MANGADEX_UUID` when two series folders pointed to the same MangaDex manga. Now checks `seriesRepository.findByMangaDexUuid()` before updating, and skips with a warning if the UUID is already assigned to another series.
- **External redirect chapters cause infinite re-queue** — MangaDex chapters that are external redirect links (`pages=0`) could never be downloaded by gallery-dl but were only blacklisted after 3 failed attempts. Now immediately auto-blacklisted on first encounter without a download attempt. Normal chapters keep the 3-failure threshold to avoid false blacklisting during MangaDex downtime.

| Modified/New Files | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `domain/service/DownloadExecutor.kt` | Pre-check before mangaDexUuid update |
| `infrastructure/download/GalleryDlWrapper.kt` | Immediate blacklist for `pages=0` chapters |

### New Features
- **Scan deleted chapters** — New "Scan deleted chapters" option in the library 3-dot menu. Compares tracked chapter URLs in the database against CBZ files on the filesystem. Removes stale entries for chapters whose files no longer exist, so re-downloads correctly detect them as missing. Runs as a background task.
- **Gallery-dl archive tracking for non-MangaDex** — Non-MangaDex downloads now use gallery-dl's built-in `--download-archive` option with a `.gallery-dl-archive.txt` file in the manga folder. This prevents duplicate folder creation and re-downloads when downloading from the same source a second time.

| Modified/New Files | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `application/tasks/Task.kt` | New `ScanDeletedChapters` task type |
| `application/tasks/TaskEmitter.kt` | `scanDeletedChapters()` submission method |
| `application/tasks/TaskHandler.kt` | Handler for scan deleted chapters task |
| `domain/service/ChapterChecker.kt` | `scanDeletedChaptersForLibrary()` logic |
| `interfaces/api/rest/LibraryController.kt` | `POST /api/v1/libraries/{id}/scan-deleted-chapters` endpoint |
| `infrastructure/download/GalleryDlWrapper.kt` | `--download-archive` for non-MangaDex downloads |
| `komga-webui/.../LibraryActionsMenu.vue` | Menu item |
| `komga-webui/.../komga-libraries.service.ts` | API client method |
| `komga-webui/.../en.json` | Translation |

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-22

### New Features
- **Download resume after crash/restart** — Downloads stuck in DOWNLOADING status (e.g. after server crash) are automatically recovered to PENDING on startup via `ContextRefreshedEvent`. Combined with existing chapter URL tracking, downloads resume from where they left off instead of starting over. Resume progress is logged with "Resuming: X/Y chapters already downloaded, Z remaining".
- **Kitsu metadata provider** — New `OnlineMetadataProvider` plugin fetching series-level metadata from Kitsu API (kitsu.app). Provides titles, synopsis, genres, authors, age rating, cover images, and alternative titles in multiple languages. No API key required.

### Bug Fixes
- **Kitsu metadata search fails** — `PluginController.getMetadataProvider()` was missing the `"kitsu-metadata"` routing, so searching via Kitsu always returned "Failed to search metadata". Added KitsuMetadataPlugin constructor parameter and when-branch.
- **Download progress shows "45/45" incrementing together** — Non-MangaDex bulk downloads (mangahere, rawkuma etc.) showed current and total incrementing together (45/45 → 49/49) because `totalChapters` was set to the current count when unknown. Now defaults to 0, which maps to `null` in the WebSocket DTO so the frontend shows only the current count.
- **Cover image not loaded after download** — `scanSeriesFolder()` (targeted scan after download) did not trigger `refreshSeriesLocalArtwork`, so the `cover.jpg` downloaded by gallery-dl was only picked up on the next full library scan.
- **MangaDex feed missing chapters for certain content ratings** — Feed API calls did not include `contentRating[]` parameters, so the API applied its default filter which excludes some rating categories. Added all four content rating levels to feed requests in GalleryDlWrapper and MangaDexSubscriptionSyncer.
- **MangaDex subscription feed always fails with 400** — `publishAtSince` was formatted with `ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME` (`2026-03-21T08:43:24.6358255Z`) but MangaDex requires exact `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` without fractional seconds or timezone suffix. Also sanitizes old DB values on read.
- **Subscription dedup always empty** — `seriesRepository.findAll()` returned series with `mangaDexUuid = null` (toDomain doesn't read MANGADEX_UUID column), so all dedup maps were empty and every chapter was queued as "unknown". Now uses `findByMangaDexUuid()` per manga on-demand.
- **CustomList dead code removed** — `initializeList()` created a MangaDex CustomList on every startup that was never used for feed checking (feed uses `/user/follows/manga/feed`). Caused duplicate "Komga Subscriptions" lists.

- **ChapterChecker executor leak on exception** — Thread pool was only shut down in happy path. If `futures.map { it.join() }` threw, the 5-thread pool leaked. Wrapped in try-finally.
- **gallery-dl process leak in `isInstalled()`** — `process.waitFor(5s)` timeout left process running. Now calls `destroyForcibly()` on timeout.
- **Reader threads not interrupted after join timeout** — stdout/stderr reader threads continued running after `join(5000)` timeout. Now interrupted if still alive.

### New Features
- **Repair ComicInfo endpoint** — New `POST /api/v1/downloads/repair-comicinfo/{libraryId}` endpoint to retroactively inject missing ComicInfo.xml and ZIP comments into existing MangaDex CBZ files. Scans library directory for MangaDex folders (UUID-named or containing series.json with MangaDex ID), fetches chapter metadata from MangaDex API, and repairs each CBZ. Skips files that already have a ZIP comment.
- **Dynamic log level toggle** — New Debug switch in the web log viewer (`Settings → Logs`) to toggle between INFO and DEBUG log level at runtime via `GET/POST /api/v1/logs/level`. No server restart needed, resets to INFO on restart.
- **Live log streaming via SSE** — New `GET /api/v1/logs/stream` SSE endpoint tails the log file in real-time. Web log viewer has Live/Pause buttons replacing the old 5-second polling. Pause buffers incoming lines and flushes on unpause.
- **Target library selection for MangaDex Subscription** — New `Target Library` config field lets users choose which library receives downloaded manga by name. Falls back to the first library if empty or not found.

### Improved
- **Target library as dropdown selection** — MangaDex Subscription's `Target Library` config field is now a dropdown populated with existing library names instead of a free-text input. Uses `dynamicEnum: "libraries"` schema marker to fetch libraries at dialog open time. Clearable (falls back to first library).
- **Plugin config dialog shows only schema-defined fields** — Frontend config dialog now iterates schema properties instead of all DB values. Orphan config entries (e.g. removed `language` field from subscription plugin) no longer show as untyped text fields.
- **36 languages in plugin dropdown** — MangaDex Subscription and gallery-dl Downloader language selection expanded from 10 to 36 languages (added zh-hk, es-la, pt-br, pl, tr, nl, id, ms, th, vi, ar, uk, hu, ro, cs, bg, el, da, fi, sv, no, lt, ca, hr, tl, hi).

### Improved
- **Error logging across download system** — Replaced ~18 silent catch blocks and DEBUG-level logs with proper WARN-level logging including stack traces. Affected files: `DownloadExecutor`, `GalleryDlWrapper`, `ChapterChecker`, `ComicInfoGenerator`, `ChapterMatcher`, `MangaDexApiClient`, `GalleryDlProcess`, `MangaDexSubscriptionSyncer`, `ChapterUrlImporter`, `DownloadController`.

### Refactored
- **GalleryDlWrapper split into 4 focused components** — Extracted `MangaDexApiClient` (API calls, metadata fetching, caching, rate limiting via `MangaDexRateLimiter`), `ComicInfoGenerator` (XML generation, ZIP comment, CBZ metadata injection), `GalleryDlProcess` (subprocess management, config files, environment setup), and `ChapterMatcher` (filename regex, chapter URL extraction, duplicate detection). `GalleryDlWrapper` remains as the facade — all 6 consumer classes still reference only `GalleryDlWrapper`. `ChapterDownloadInfo` moved from nested class to top-level. Dead code `downloadCover()` (gallery-dl based) removed.

### Performance
- **Plugin config caching (60s TTL)** — `GalleryDlWrapper` now caches plugin config in memory instead of querying the database on every method call. Reduces DB queries during downloads.
- **Atomic series.json writes** — `series.json` is now written to a temp file first, then moved atomically (`ATOMIC_MOVE` with fallback). Prevents corruption if process crashes mid-write.
- **Background cache eviction** — Chapter cache, manga info cache, and plugin config cache are now evicted by a scheduled job every 10 minutes instead of only on access.
- **Pre-compiled regex constants in GalleryDlWrapper** — 5 regex patterns (`extractChapterId`, `extractChapterNumberFromFilename`, `parseGalleryDlProgress`, `extractChapterNumFromFilename`, scanlation group) moved from per-call compilation to companion object constants.
- **Single directory traversal after download** — Replaced 2× `walkTopDown()` + 1× `listFiles()` with a single `walkTopDown()` pass for CBZ file collection and empty directory cleanup.
- **Cached library list in ChapterChecker** — `libraryRepository.findAll()` called once in `checkUrls()` and passed through to `checkSingleUrl()`, `findSeriesForManga()`, and `buildFolderIndex()`. Eliminates ~300 redundant DB queries per chapter check run.
- **Blacklist filtered by series** — `blacklistedChapterRepository.findAll()` replaced with `findUrlsBySeriesId()` when series ID is known, avoiding loading the entire blacklist table on every download.
- **O(1) chapter lookup in ComicInfo injection** — `updateExistingCbzChapterUrls()` pre-indexes chapters by padded/plain number into a Map. Previously O(n×m) linear search per CBZ file (1M comparisons for 1000 chapters × 1000 CBZs), now O(n+m).
- **Hash set computed once in series restore** — `newBooksWithHash.map { it.fileHash }.toSet()` was recomputed inside `find` loop per deleted candidate. Now computed once before the loop.

### Modified Files

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-16

### New Features
- **Series survives folder rename** — When a manga folder is renamed, Komga now detects the same series via `mangaDexUuid` (from `series.json` or UUID folder name) and restores it instead of creating a new one. Preserves browser URL, reading progress, collections, and metadata. Compatible with upstream Komga (no DB schema changes).
- **Remove known duplicate page hashes** — New `DELETE /api/v1/page-hashes/{pageHash}` endpoint and WebUI button to permanently remove entries from the known duplicate pages list. Previously only IGNORE was available, causing the list to grow indefinitely.
- **ZIP file comments in CBZ** — CBZ files now include metadata as ZIP file comments: `Title`, `Title UUID`, `Chapter UUID`, `Chapter`, `Volume`. Compatible with all manga downloaders (none use the ZIP comment field). Only Calibre's ComicBookInfo plugin uses this field, but with a different JSON format that doesn't conflict.
- **Auto-scan after download** — New chapters are automatically scanned after all downloads complete. Collects downloaded series folders during the download queue and scans them all via targeted `scanSeriesFolder()` once the queue is empty — no scan per individual download, no full library scan. `scanSeriesFolder` creates new series if needed (with `tryRestoreByMangaDexUuid` fallback), imports chapter URLs only for the affected series, and syncs MangaDex UUID per series. Full library scan remains unchanged for manual use.
- **Configurable folder naming** — New `folder_naming` plugin config for gallery-dl-downloader. Options: `uuid` (default, uses MangaDex UUID like `0c6fe779-...`) or `title` (uses manga title like `Roman Club`). Set in Plugin Manager → gallery-dl Downloader settings. Only affects new manga — existing folders are never renamed.
- **MangaDex Subscription Feed** — New `mangadex-subscription` plugin that watches the MangaDex follow feed (`GET /user/follows/manga/feed?publishAtSince=...`) for new chapters and auto-queues downloads. Uses OAuth2 personal client auth and checks the feed at a configurable interval (default 30 min). Deduplicates against existing DB state: checks `mangaDexUuid` → series → CHAPTER_URL IDs, blacklisted chapter IDs, and URL existence before queuing. Groups new chapters by manga to avoid duplicate downloads when both follow.txt and subscription are active. When a manga is newly added to the follow list, all chapters are downloaded (not just new ones since last check) — detected by checking `GET /user/follows/manga` against existing series in DB via `mangaDexUuid`. Disabled by default — requires MangaDex API credentials in Plugin Manager.

### Bug Fixes
- **Download progress counter includes auto-blacklisted chapters** — Progress showed e.g. "2/14" when 12 of 14 chapters were auto-blacklisted. Now excludes auto-blacklisted chapters from the total, showing "2/2" instead.
- **Chapter URLs falsely removed as "stale"** — `importFromSeriesPath` compared DB URLs against URLs extracted from ComicInfo.xml in all CBZ files. If `extractComicInfo` failed for any file (I/O error, missing Web tag, file rewritten by removeHashedPages), the URL was deleted as "stale" even though the CBZ still existed. Removed the stale URL cleanup entirely — it caused a vicious cycle of remove/reimport and forced full CBZ reads on every scan.
- **Excessive I/O during chapter URL import** — Every manual library scan opened all ~16,000 CBZ files to read ComicInfo.xml, overwhelming HDDs. Fixed: fast-path now uses `>=` instead of `==` (skip when DB has at least as many URLs as CBZ files), and URL extraction uses ZIP comments (200 bytes, no decompression) with ComicInfo.xml fallback for older files without comments.
- **In-CBZ duplicate page detection destroys CBZ files** — `addComicInfoToCbz` and `addComicInfoToCbzWithChapterInfo` grouped ZIP entries by page name (without extension) and removed "duplicates". When the same chapter was uploaded twice by the same group on MangaDex, gallery-dl downloaded both into the same directory, creating legitimate same-named files in different formats. The detection then removed most/all pages, producing empty CBZ files that were never properly tracked, causing infinite re-download loops. Removed the in-CBZ duplicate detection entirely.
- **Same-group duplicate chapters cause re-download loop** — When a scanlation group uploads the same chapter twice on MangaDex (different UUIDs, same chapter number, same group), both were downloaded into the same directory causing conflicts. Now auto-detects same-group duplicates across ALL API chapters (not just remaining), keeps the newest upload, auto-blacklists the older one. Also registers chapter URLs directly in the DB after successful download, bypassing the ChapterUrlImporter fast-path that skipped import when CBZ file count hadn't changed.
- **MangaDex feed missing chapters for certain content ratings** — Feed API calls did not include `contentRating[]` parameters, so the API applied its default filter which excludes some rating categories. Added all four content rating levels to feed requests in GalleryDlWrapper and MangaDexSubscriptionSyncer.
- **gallery-dl process output race condition** — `filesDownloaded` counter was a plain `Int` incremented by stdout-thread and read by stderr-thread. Changed to `AtomicInteger`. Reader threads are now joined after `process.waitFor()` to ensure all output is captured before checking results.
- **Date substring IndexOutOfBoundsException** — `publishDate.substring(0, 4)` crashed when the date string was shorter than expected. Now checks `length >= 4/7/10` before extracting year/month/day.
- **Temp config file leaked on exception** — gallery-dl config files created in `/tmp` were not deleted when `GalleryDlException` or generic `Exception` was thrown. Added cleanup in both catch blocks.
- **Blacklist insert race condition** — Concurrent downloads could try to insert the same blacklist entry simultaneously, causing duplicate-key crash. Wrapped both insert sites with try-catch, logging duplicates at DEBUG level.
- **DownloadExecutor processing flag outside submitted task** — `processing.set(false)` was called immediately after `submit()` instead of in the task's `finally` block, allowing duplicate download submissions. Moved back inside `finally`.
- **Folder index overwrite in ChapterChecker** — `buildFolderIndex()` used `index[uuid] = dir` for series.json entries, overwriting UUID→folder mappings from directory names. Changed to `putIfAbsent` so directory-name UUIDs take priority.

### Improved
- **Disabled metadata provider log spam suppressed** — `BookMetadataLifecycle` and `SeriesMetadataLifecycle` logged "skipping" messages at INFO level for every disabled provider (e.g. EpubMetadataProvider) on every book/series scan. Changed to DEBUG level.
- **Chapter check log spam reduced** — `ChapterChecker` and `GalleryDlWrapper` logged ~2000 lines per follow.txt check (5-6 lines per manga × 297 manga). Demoted to DEBUG: per-manga fetch counts, title resolution, metadata details, and "Up to date" confirmations. Only manga with missing chapters now appear at INFO level.
- **Chapter URL check uses DB → ZIP comment → ComicInfo.xml** — `GalleryDlWrapper` now queries the `CHAPTER_URL` database table first, then falls back to ZIP comment extraction, then ComicInfo.xml parsing. Previously opened every CBZ file to read ComicInfo.xml before each download.
- **Pre-compiled regex constants** — Moved `<Web>` regex, volume prefix regex, and bracket group regex from inline creation (per-file/per-match) to companion object constants, avoiding repeated compilation in loops.
- **Plugin config renders enum fields as dropdowns** — Plugin Manager config dialog now uses `v-select` for fields with `enum` in the JSON schema (e.g. `folder_naming`, `default_language`). Also uses schema `title` as label, `description` as hint, and `format: "password"` for password detection. Previously all fields were plain text inputs.
- **Plugin configSchema auto-updates** — `PluginInitializer` now updates the `configSchema` on existing plugins when it changes, instead of skipping them. New config fields (like `folder_naming`) appear immediately after restart without requiring a DB reset.
- **Chapter check uses ID comparison instead of count** — ChapterChecker now fetches all chapter IDs from the MangaDex feed and compares them directly against the DB (chapter_url + blacklist). Previously used inflated API total count which included duplicate uploads, causing permanent re-queuing for manga with duplicate entries.
- **MangaDex API call caching** — GalleryDlWrapper caches `/manga/{id}` metadata and `/manga/{id}/feed` chapter data for 30 minutes. ChapterChecker and download share the same cache, eliminating duplicate API calls. Previously each check+download cycle made 9+ requests per manga, now 2 (one feed, one metadata).
- **Feed pagination limit increased** — `fetchAllChaptersFromMangaDex` uses `limit=500` instead of `limit=100`, reducing pagination requests for large manga (e.g. 500 chapters: 1 request instead of 5).
- **Removed redundant pre-check in DownloadExecutor** — `processDownload` no longer calls `getMangaDexChapterCount` before starting a download. The ID-based check in ChapterChecker is more accurate and already cached.
- **Chapter URL import skips unchanged series** — `importFromSeriesPath` compares CBZ file count against DB URL count. If they match, the series is skipped entirely without opening any CBZ files. Previously every library scan re-read ComicInfo.xml from all ~16,000 CBZ files (15 min), now only series with changes are scanned.

### Performance
- **Shared HttpClient in GalleryDlWrapper** — Reuse a single `HttpClient` instance instead of creating one per request (5 occurrences). Reduces GC pressure and connection setup overhead.
- **Thread-safe MangaDex throttling** — `lastMangaDexRequestTime` uses `AtomicLong` + `@Synchronized` to prevent race conditions in concurrent API calls.
- **Cache eviction for MangaDex API data** — `chapterCache` and `mangaInfoCache` now evict expired entries on access, preventing unbounded memory growth over long-running sessions.
- **Bounded process output buffer** — Gallery-dl stdout/stderr capture is limited to 512 KB via `appendBounded()`, preventing OOM on extremely verbose downloads.
- **Safe file operations** — All `File.delete()` calls check return values via `deleteQuietly()` helper; `renameTo()` replaced with `Files.move()` for reliable cross-filesystem moves.
- **Plugin config loaded once per download** — `pluginConfigRepository` is queried once at the start of `download()` instead of per temp-config-file creation.
- **Silent exceptions logged** — 9 swallowed `catch (_: Exception)` blocks now log at DEBUG level for diagnostics.
- **Log level cleanup** — 20+ internal detail logs demoted from INFO to DEBUG (gallery-dl stdout/stderr, ComicInfo injection, ZIP comments, CBZ moves, series.json writes).
- **Folder index in ChapterChecker** — `buildFolderIndex()` scans libraries once and builds a `Map<String, File>`, replacing per-manga O(n) folder search with O(1) lookup.
- **Executor shutdown fallback** — `ChapterChecker` and `DownloadExecutor` thread pools use `shutdownNow()` fallback after timeout, plus `@PreDestroy` lifecycle management.
- **Race condition fixes in DownloadExecutor** — `processing` flag set after `submit()` (not in task's `finally`), `cancelledIds`/`activeDownloads` synchronized, `pendingScans` protected by dedicated lock.
- **Batch queries in MangaDexSubscriptionSyncer** — `isChapterKnown()` uses pre-loaded `HashMap` lookups instead of 3 DB queries per chapter (N+1 → O(1)). Library loaded once and passed through.
- **Single-pass XML parsing in ChapterUrlImporter** — `parseComicInfoXml()` iterates line-by-line with early-exit instead of 6 separate full-string regex scans.
- **O(1) findExistingMangaFolder in DownloadExecutor** — Replaced `findAllByLibraryId()` + iteration with direct `findNotDeletedByLibraryIdAndUrlOrNull()` DB query. Eliminates O(n) series scan on every download.
- **Progress DB-writes throttled to 5s interval** — Download progress callback wrote to DB on every gallery-dl output line. Now writes at most every 5 seconds. Websocket broadcast remains real-time.
- **Token refresh thread-safety in MangaDexSubscriptionSyncer** — `getValidToken()` annotated with `@Synchronized` to prevent duplicate token refresh requests. `scheduledTask` marked `@Volatile` for cross-thread visibility. Early-return with warning when library not found.

### Security
- **Spring Boot 3.5.11 → 3.5.12** — Fixes CVE-2026-22732 (Spring Security Web 6.5.8 → 6.5.9, severity 9.1) and CVE-2026-22737 / CVE-2026-22735 (Spring WebFlux 6.2.16 → 6.2.17).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### New Features
- **Manual blacklist URL entry** — Users can now manually paste MangaDex chapter URLs into the "Manage Blacklist" dialog. Useful for the rare edge case where MangaDex has duplicate uploads from the same scanlation group (e.g. manga cbce49c7 has 27 API entries for 11 unique chapters, all from the same group), causing permanent re-queuing since the API total can never match the DB/filesystem count. New `POST /api/v1/series/{seriesId}/blacklist` endpoint accepts `chapterUrl`, `chapterNumber`, and `chapterTitle`.

### Bug Fixes
- **CHAPTER_URL entries deleted on soft-delete** — `BookLifecycle.softDeleteMany` deleted CHAPTER_URL entries when books were soft-deleted (e.g. during library scan when CBZ files were modified by ComicInfo.xml injection). This caused `countDownloadedChapters` to return decreasing values over time, making the ChapterChecker think chapters were missing and re-queue downloads. Fixed by removing the CHAPTER_URL deletion from soft-delete — only hard-delete (via FK CASCADE on SERIES) and explicit API delete should remove entries.
- **mangaDexUuid overwritten with null on every series update** — `SeriesDao.toDomain()` can't read `MANGADEX_UUID` (jOOQ codegen not run), so every normal Komga series update (book count, metadata, etc.) wrote `mangaDexUuid = null` back to DB. Fixed by only writing `mangaDexUuid` in `insert()`/`update()` when the value is not null.
- **syncMangaDexUuid ran for all ~300 series every library scan** — Because `mangaDexUuid` was always null in the Series object (see above), `syncMangaDexUuid` re-read `series.json` and re-set the UUID for every series on every scan. Fixed by checking via `findByMangaDexUuid` whether the UUID is already correctly assigned before reading `series.json`.
- **CBZ file detection failed for volume-prefixed filenames** — After gallery-dl downloads a chapter, ComicInfo.xml injection couldn't find the CBZ because it only matched `c021`/`c21` but not `v4 c021 [Group]`. Fixed by stripping `v<N> ` prefix before matching.
- **Chapter URL import too late in library scan** — `scanAndImportLibrary()` ran at the very end of `scanRootFolder()`, after sidecars and trash cleanup. ChapterChecker saw stale DB counts because URLs hadn't been imported yet. Moved to right after series/book updates, before tasks are emitted.
- **Orchesc/a/ns duplicate CBZ files** — Gallery-dl created both `[Orchesc a ns].cbz` and `[Orchesc_a_ns].cbz` because slashes in scanlation group names were sanitized inconsistently across runs. Added `path-restrict: auto` and `path-replace: _` to mangadex gallery-dl config for consistent filename sanitization.

### Changed
- **Fork migrations separated from upstream** — Fork database migrations now use a dedicated `flyway_fork_history` table instead of the shared `flyway_schema_history`. This allows seamless switching between official Komga and the fork without manual database cleanup. Existing fork entries are automatically moved from `flyway_schema_history` to `flyway_fork_history` on first startup.

### Removed
- **Redundant download tables** — Dropped `DOWNLOAD_CHAPTER_HISTORY` and `DOWNLOAD_ITEM` tables (Flyway migration). Both were never used in code (repositories existed but were never injected). `CHAPTER_URL` is the single source of truth for downloaded chapter tracking. Also removed `DownloadChapterHistory.kt`, `DownloadChapterHistoryRepository.kt`, `DownloadChapterHistoryDao.kt`, `DownloadItemRepository.kt`, `DownloadItemDao.kt`, and `DownloadItem` from `DownloadQueue.kt`.

### Modified Files
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `SeriesDao.kt` | `insert()`/`update()` only write `mangaDexUuid` when not null |
| `ChapterUrlImporter.kt` | `syncMangaDexUuid` checks DB before reading series.json |
| `BookLifecycle.kt` | Removed CHAPTER_URL deletion from `softDeleteMany` |
| `GalleryDlWrapper.kt` | CBZ detection strips `v<N> ` prefix, added `path-restrict`/`path-replace` for consistent filename sanitization |
| `LibraryContentLifecycle.kt` | Moved `scanAndImportLibrary()` earlier in scan, before task emission |
| `SeriesController.kt` | New `POST /api/v1/series/{seriesId}/blacklist` for manual URL blacklisting |
| `BlacklistDialog.vue` | Added URL input field for manual blacklist entries |
| `komga-series.service.ts` | Added `addBlacklist()` method |
| `FlywayForkMigrationInitializer.kt` | Separate fork migration history table, auto-migrates from `flyway_schema_history` |
| `V20260315000001__drop_redundant_download_tables.sql` | Drop `DOWNLOAD_CHAPTER_HISTORY` and `DOWNLOAD_ITEM` |

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-14

### New Features
- **MangaDex UUID ↔ Komga Series ID mapping** — New `MANGADEX_UUID` column on the SERIES table (Flyway migration) enables direct DB lookup between MangaDex manga UUIDs and Komga series IDs. Eliminates filesystem scanning for series identification. `DownloadExecutor` sets `mangaDexUuid` on the series after successful download. `ChapterChecker` and `findExistingMangaFolder` use direct DB lookup as primary method, falling back to filesystem scan only when no DB mapping exists.
- **ChapterUrlImporter imports from ComicInfo.xml** — During library scan, reads `<Web>` tags from ComicInfo.xml inside CBZ files and imports chapter URLs into the `CHAPTER_URL` table with the correct Komga series ID. Enables accurate `countDownloadedChapters` via DB instead of filesystem counting. Also extracts chapter number, volume, title, language, and scanlation group from ComicInfo.xml.
- **MangaDex Subscription Feed Sync** — New plugin (`mangadex-subscription`) that watches your MangaDex follow feed for new chapters and auto-downloads them. Uses OAuth2 personal client auth, auto-creates and subscribes to a CustomList. Periodic feed checks (default every 30 min) query `GET /user/follows/manga/feed?publishAtSince=...` for new chapters and queue them for download. Requires a MangaDex personal API client (OAuth2 password grant). Completely independent from the existing follow.txt system. Disabled by default — configure credentials in Plugin Manager to enable.
- **`gallery_dl_path` plugin config** — New config option to point Komga at a local gallery-dl source checkout (e.g. `/path/to/gallery-dl/`). Sets `PYTHONPATH` on all gallery-dl subprocess calls so `python -m gallery_dl` loads from the local source instead of the system-installed package. Useful for running the latest gallery-dl with new extractors (e.g. weebdex.py) without reinstalling.

### Bug Fixes
- **7 missing chapters not downloading** — CBZ filename matching in `GalleryDlWrapper` falsely marked multi-group chapters as "already downloaded" when only a different group's version existed. Removed filename matching entirely — only URL-based matching (ComicInfo.xml `<Web>` tag) and blacklist are used now.
- **6 mangas unnecessarily queued every check** — `ChapterChecker.countDownloadedChapters` searched `url.contains(mangaId)` but chapter URLs don't contain manga IDs, so DB count was always 0. Fixed to use `findSeriesForManga` + `countBySeriesId`. Known count now uses `maxOf(dbCount, fsCount) + blacklistedCount`.
- **Guest browsing ("als Gast durchsuchen") broken** — `GuestAccessFilter` used `request.requestURI` which includes the `/komga` context path, so `isGuestPath()` never matched. Fixed to use `request.servletPath`.
- **CBZ file detection after download fails for volume-prefixed filenames** — After gallery-dl downloads a chapter, ComicInfo.xml injection couldn't find the CBZ because it only matched `c021` / `c21` but not `v4 c021 [Group]`. Now strips `v<N> ` prefix before matching.
- **BookControllerTest ConcurrentModificationException** — Unicode book file test failed with `ConcurrentModificationException` in Spring Boot actuator's `HttpExchangesFilter`. Fixed by making `HttpExchangeConfiguration` conditional on `management.httpexchanges.recording.enabled` property and disabling it in test profile.
- **Race condition: ChapterChecker reports false "new chapters"** — `countFilesystemChapters()` relied on reading `series.json` to find manga folders. When the download worker was writing `series.json` simultaneously, the file was briefly unreadable, causing the filesystem count to drop to 0. Now checks UUID folder name directly first (no file I/O needed), falling back to `series.json` scan only for non-UUID folders.
- **Downloads processed even when all chapters exist** — Full gallery-dl process ran even when nothing to download. Now performs a lightweight pre-check: compares CBZ count on disk against MangaDex API chapter count, and skips the download immediately if all chapters are already present.
- **BLACKLISTED_CHAPTER FK constraint violation** — `seriesId` was set to MangaDex UUID instead of Komga's internal SERIES.ID, causing every blacklist insert to crash. Now passes the correct Komga series ID from `findExistingMangaFolder`.
- **Unnecessary ComicInfo.xml rewrites on every run** — `hasMismatchedDates()` decompressed and recompressed every CBZ to check dates, even when nothing changed. Replaced with `hasComicInfoXml()` that only checks file existence.
- **gallery-dl compatibility with non-MangaDex sites** — `parseGalleryDlJson` only handled Queue messages (type 6) used by MangaDex extractors. Single-image sites like wallhaven.cc yield Directory (type 2) + Url (type 3) messages which were ignored. Now processes all three message types and uses a title fallback chain.
- **Title "Unknown" crash for non-MangaDex URLs** — `getChapterInfo()` threw `GalleryDlException` when the extracted title was "Unknown". Now derives a fallback title from the URL.
- **Downloads saved to "Unknown" folder when title not yet known** — `DownloadExecutor.processDownload()` used the queued title as the folder name before `getChapterInfo` resolved the real title. Now renames/moves files into the correct folder after download completes.
- **Publisher hardcoded to "MangaDex" for all sites** — Now derives the publisher from the source URL domain.
- **"Search Online Metadata" button not applying metadata** — Now calls `PATCH /api/v1/series/{id}/metadata` to apply metadata directly.
- **Non-MangaDex multi-chapter sites only downloaded 1 CBZ** — Now extracts chapter info from Queue messages and downloads each chapter individually.
- **MangaDex 429 rate limit crashes downloads** — Now retries up to 2 times with 5-second delays when rate-limited.
- **Re-downloads when MangaDex title changes** — `findExistingMangaFolder()` now searches both folder names and `series.json` content for the MangaDex UUID.
- **Bulk re-download when MangaDex chapter API returns empty** — Now returns early for MangaDex URLs when the chapter API returns empty.
- **Paid/unavailable chapters retried indefinitely** — Now tracks failures in `.chapter-failures.json` per manga folder and auto-blacklists chapters after 3 failed attempts.

### Changed
- **UUID folder names for MangaDex downloads** — Download folders now use the MangaDex UUID as folder name instead of the manga title. Eliminates re-downloads caused by MangaDex title changes.
- **No more CBZ file renaming** — gallery-dl's native filenames (e.g. `c005 [No Group Scanlation].cbz`) are kept as-is.
- **Simplified MangaDex folder naming** — Download destination is always `<libraryPath>/<mangaDexId>` directly.
- **Dockerfile fix** — Removed `dpkg-architecture` call that caused build failure (exit code 127), changed `WORKDIR app` to `WORKDIR /app`.
- **Backup files removed from git** — `.before_*`, `.2025*`, `.2026*` patterns added to `.gitignore`, existing tracked backup files removed.

### Performance
- **Docker build ~50% faster** — Pre-built kepubify binary instead of Go compilation (~6 min saved), runtime libs instead of -dev packages, removed `apt-get upgrade`, dropped arm/v7 (32-bit ARM), added GitHub Actions Docker layer cache (`cache-from/cache-to: type=gha`)
- **Sass 1.79 migration** — Bumped `sass` from `^1.32.13` to `~1.79.0` so `silenceDeprecations: ['slash-div']` takes effect, eliminating ~475 Vuetify SASS deprecation warnings during frontend build

### Removed
- `buildDesiredCbzName`, `sanitizeFsName`, `getEnglishTitleForFolderName`, `isUuidDerivedTitle` — dead code after removing CBZ rename logic
- **CBZ filename matching** — Removed entirely from chapter filter in `GalleryDlWrapper`. Only URL-based matching and blacklist remain.
- **arm/v7 (32-bit ARM) Docker platform** — barely used, extremely slow under QEMU emulation. arm64 and amd64 remain.
- **Go toolchain from Docker build** — kepubify is now downloaded as pre-built binary from GitHub releases

### Modified Files

|------|---------|
| `Series.kt` | Added `mangaDexUuid: String? = null` field |
| `SeriesRepository.kt` | Added `findByMangaDexUuid()` |
| `SeriesDao.kt` | Implemented `findByMangaDexUuid`, `mangaDexUuid` in insert/update |

## [0.0.8] - 2026-02-28

### Improved
- **Primary title added to alternate titles** — The main MangaDex `title` (e.g., romaji "Sagishi to Keisatsukan no Rennai Kyori") is now included in `alternate_titles` in `series.json`. Previously only `altTitles` from the API were collected, so the primary title was lost if an alt English title was used as the series name.
- **Background scanning** — `/check-new` and `/follow-txt/{id}/check-now` now return 202 Accepted immediately and run the chapter check in the background. Previously checking 200 mangas blocked the HTTP request for minutes and froze the UI. New PENDING items appear automatically via the existing 5-second poll.
- **Gradle build cache** — Enabled `org.gradle.caching=true` and `org.gradle.parallel=true` in `gradle.properties`, added `buildCache { local { enabled = true } }` to `settings.gradle`. Expected CI speedup of ~2-3 minutes per build.
- **Release workflow speedup** — Merged separate `version` job into `release` job (saves runner startup), replaced `fetch-depth: 0` with shallow clone + `gh release list`, removed unnecessary `Pull latest changes` step.
- **Docker image optimized** — Switched from Ubuntu 24.10 (EOL, needed `old-releases.ubuntu.com` hack) to 24.04 LTS (stable mirrors). Added `--no-install-recommends` and `pip3 --no-cache-dir` for smaller image and faster builds. Fixed `org.opencontainers.image.source` label to point to fork repo.

### New Features
- **Chapter Blacklist** — Blacklist specific chapters from the book 3-dot menu ("Blacklist & Delete") to prevent re-download. The chapter is added to the blacklist and the book file is automatically deleted. Persists even after book deletion. Skipped by downloader and chapter checker. Manage all blacklisted chapters via "Manage Blacklist" in the series 3-dot menu.
- **"All" option in page size selector** — Added "All" to the page size menu (20/50/100/200/500/All) in series and book browse views. The selected page size now persists correctly across page reloads, including when "All" is selected.

### Bug Fixes
- **ChapterChecker used wrong MangaDex API endpoint** — `fetchMangaDexAggregate()` used `/manga/{id}/aggregate` which deduplicates chapters by chapter number, returning incorrect counts when multiple scanlation groups upload the same chapter (e.g. 59 instead of 67). Switched to `/manga/{id}/feed?translatedLanguage[]={lang}&limit=0` which returns the correct `total` field including all chapter entries. Also reads the configured download language from plugin settings instead of hardcoding `en`.
- **"Rows per page" not persisted in data tables** — Page size selection in OversizedPages, DuplicateFiles, MediaAnalysis, MissingPosters, HistoryView, PageHashMatchesTable, and AuthenticationActivityTable was reset to default on every page reload. Added `dataTablePageSize` to Vuex persisted state so the selection survives page reloads and is shared across all data table views.
- **Series "date updated" sorting used filesystem timestamp instead of ComicInfo.xml date** — Sorting by `lastModifiedDate` used the Series entity's `LAST_MODIFIED_DATE` column (filesystem timestamp), so all series scanned together had nearly identical dates. Now uses a scalar subquery `MAX(book_metadata.RELEASE_DATE)` joined through BOOK to sort by the latest ComicInfo.xml publication date in the series.
- **Lucene range queries broken by search escaping** — The v0.0.8 search fix escaped all special characters including `[`, `]`, `:` in range queries like `release_date:[1990 TO 2010]`. The `]` in `2010]` was escaped to `2010\]`, breaking range query syntax. Now detects range queries (`field:[a TO b]`) as a unit before splitting by spaces.
- **Search broken with `-` and `:` characters** — Searching for titles like "Re:Zero" or "Sword Art Online - Alicization" returned no results because `-` (NOT operator) and `:` (field separator) are Lucene query syntax characters. The parser threw a `ParseException` which was silently caught, returning empty results. Now escapes all special characters via `QueryParser.escape()` before parsing.
- **Chapter CBZ matching grabbed wrong file** — After downloading a chapter, the fallback `recentCbzFiles.firstOrNull()` blindly grabbed any recently modified CBZ when the chapter-number match failed, causing chapters to contain images from completely different chapters (e.g. chapter 341 containing chapter 91's images). Removed the blind fallback; matching now strictly requires chapter number in the filename. Also tightened `startsWith` checks to require a space/delimiter after the chapter number to prevent false prefix matches.
- **Double bracket filenames causing duplicate downloads** — Gallery-dl creates filenames like `c054 [['group']].cbz` with double brackets. These didn't match the expected `c054 [group]` pattern, causing chapters to be re-downloaded. Added `normalizeDoubleBracketFilenames()` to rename `[['x']]` → `[x]` before chapter matching. Now also called after both bulk and per-chapter download paths.
- **ComicInfo.xml updated unnecessarily** — `updateExistingCbzChapterUrls` was processing the same file multiple times (once per scanlation group) and triggering updates even when dates were correct. Added `alreadyUpdated` set to prevent double processing, and improved `hasMismatchedDates()` to check Year+Month+Day (was only checking Year).
- **Fixed double brackets `[['group']]` in CBZ filenames** — gallery-dl's `{group}` returns a Python list, which when stringified produces `['group']`. Combined with the `[{group}]` format wrapper this created `[['group']]` directories. Fixed by using `{group:J, }` format specifier which joins list elements into a plain string.
- **Decimal chapter matching broken** — `54.2` was not zero-padded to `054.2`, causing ComicInfo.xml injection and date updates to silently fail for decimal chapters. Extracted shared `padChapterNumber()` helper that handles both integer (`5` → `005`) and decimal (`54.2` → `054.2`) chapter numbers. Replaced 4 inline padding blocks.
- **Bulk download path didn't rename CBZ files** — Only the per-chapter download loop called `buildDesiredCbzName` to rename files to `Ch. 001 - Title [Group].cbz` format. Bulk download path now also renames after ComicInfo injection.
- **`updateExistingCbzChapterUrls` missing `c$paddedNum` patterns** — Matching only checked `c$chapterStr` (unpadded) but gallery-dl creates `c054` (padded) filenames. Added `c$paddedNum` and `c$paddedNum ` patterns so padded filenames are correctly matched.
- **ChapterChecker false positives — all manga queued as PENDING** — `countFilesystemChapters()` searches `series.json` for the mangaDexId string, but `series.json` never stored it. Every manga returned 0 filesystem chapters, so all 184 were queued as needing download. Now stores `comicid` (mangaDexId) and `cover_filename` in `series.json` metadata via the `MangaInfo` data class.
- **Cover images re-downloaded every run** — `downloadMangaCover()` was called unconditionally with no existence check, re-downloading ~187 cover images. Each overwrite triggered Komga's sidecar detection → artwork refresh → metadata refresh cascade (~30,000 tasks). Now checks if cover file exists and `cover_filename` hasn't changed before downloading.
- **series.json rewritten unnecessarily** — `createSeriesJson()` always overwrote the file even when content was identical, triggering Komga's filesystem watcher cascade. Now compares new content with existing file and skips rewrite when unchanged.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-02-23

### New Features

#### Guest/Kiosk Mode (#1202)
- **Read-only browsing without login** — Toggleable in admin Settings → UI. When enabled, a "Als Gast durchsuchen" button appears on the login page, allowing unauthenticated users to browse series, books, and libraries without creating an account.
- **Per-library guest access** — Admins can select which libraries are visible to guests. Empty selection = all libraries. Backend enforces library restrictions via a virtual `KomgaUser` with `sharedLibrariesIds`.
- **Security** — Guest access is limited to GET requests on `/api/v1/series/**`, `/api/v1/books/**`, `/api/v1/libraries/**`. Admin, account, settings, downloads, and import routes are blocked for guests. Navigation drawer hides admin sections and shows a Login link instead of Logout.

#### Logs in Web UI (#80)
- **Admin-only log viewer** — New Settings → Logs page displays the last N lines of `komga.log` in a dark monospace viewer with color-coded log levels (ERROR=red, WARN=orange, DEBUG=grey).
- **Auto-refresh** — Toggle 5-second polling to watch logs in real time.
- **Search/filter** — Client-side text filter to quickly find log entries.
- **Download** — Full log file download via `GET /api/v1/logs/download`.
- **API** — `GET /api/v1/logs?lines=500` returns last N lines as `text/plain`.

#### Custom Color Themes (#1427)
- **7 predefined theme presets** — Default, AMOLED, Nord, Dracula, Solarized, Green, Red. Each preset defines both light and dark mode colors.
- **Persistent selection** — Theme preset is saved in browser local storage and applied on startup.
- **UI** — Clickable preset cards with icon, label, and color preview dots in Account → UI Settings.

#### Fork Version Check
- **Fork update notifications** — The Updates page now has two tabs: "Upstream (Komga)" and "Fork". Fork releases are fetched from `08shiro80/komga-enhanced` GitHub releases with a separate 1-hour cache.
- **Badge indicators** — The version badge in the nav drawer and the Updates nav item show a warning dot when either upstream or fork updates are available.
- **API** — `GET /api/v1/releases/fork` returns fork releases from GitHub (admin-only, 1-hour cached).

#### Configurable Download Scheduler
- **Single unified scheduler** — Removed the hardcoded `@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 */6 * * *")` annotation that ran every 6 hours alongside the dynamic `TaskScheduler`. Now only one dynamic scheduler runs, eliminating duplicate chapter checks.
- **Interval or Fixed Time** — New `scheduleMode` setting: `"interval"` (repeat every N hours, existing behavior) or `"fixed_time"` (run once daily at a specific `HH:mm` time using `CronTrigger`).
- **UI controls** — The Configuration tab now shows a radio group to pick Interval vs Fixed Time, with the appropriate input (hours slider or time picker) shown for each mode.

### Bug Fixes
- **Guest mode: read buttons grayed out** — `guestBrowse()` never populated the store's `me` user object, so `mePageStreaming` was always false and all read buttons were disabled. Now sets a synthetic guest user with `PAGE_STREAMING` role in the store. Also restores the guest user on page refresh in the router guard. Added `/api/v1/users/me` to `GuestAccessFilter` allowed paths.
- **Guest mode: read progress FK crash** — The guest filter's authentication leaked to the HTTP session, causing non-GET requests (like `markReadProgress`) to run as the virtual guest user (ID `"guest"`) which doesn't exist in the database, triggering `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`. Fixed by: (1) clearing guest SecurityContext after each request so it never persists to the session, (2) skipping `markProgress` in DivinaReader and EpubReader when in guest mode.
- **ComicInfo.xml wrong dates** — Year/Month/Day were inconsistent: Year used the manga's start year (e.g. 2021) while Month/Day used the chapter's publish date (e.g. 01/19 from 2025-01-19), resulting in dates like 2021-01-19 instead of 2025-01-19. Chapter `publishDate` now takes priority for all three fields. Manga start year is only used as fallback when no chapter publish date is available.
- **Auto-fix dates in existing CBZ files** — `updateExistingCbzChapterUrls` now checks all existing CBZ files for mismatched dates (Year doesn't match publishDate year) and regenerates ComicInfo.xml with correct dates. Runs automatically during the next download for each manga.
- **Single-download path missing chapter metadata** — When the MangaDex API chapter list was empty on first attempt, the fallback single-download path injected ComicInfo.xml with series metadata only (no chapter title, publish date, scanlation group). Now retries fetching the chapter list from MangaDex API after gallery-dl completes, matches chapters by number extracted from filenames, and injects full chapter metadata.
- **Guest mode: libraries not loading** — Guest users always landed on the "No libraries" welcome page because the startup flow (which loads libraries) was skipped in guest mode. `guestBrowse()` now loads libraries before navigating. The router guard also loads libraries on page refresh for guests.
- **Guest mode: lost on page refresh** — `guestMode` was not persisted across page reloads. Now stored in `vuex-persistedstate` so guest sessions survive browser refresh. If guest access was disabled server-side, the guest is redirected to login.
- **Guest mode: login not clearing guest state** — Logging in via credentials while `guestMode` was persisted could leave stale guest state. `performLogin()` now clears `guestMode` before authenticating.

### Improved
- **Search: partial word matching** — Search now works with incomplete words beyond the first term. Previously, typing "tensei s" returned no results because single-character terms couldn't match the NGram index (minGram=3). Each search word is now treated as a prefix query (`tensei* s*`), so partial input immediately finds matches without needing to type full words.

### Security
- **Downloads page hidden for non-admin users** — The `/downloads` navigation link is now only visible to admin users (`v-if="isAdmin"`). Added `adminGuard` to the route so non-admin users navigating directly to `/downloads` are redirected to home. Backend already enforced `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` on all download API endpoints.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-02-22

### Performance
- **JPEG page hashing 10-50x faster** — Replaced full image decode/re-encode (`ImageIO.read` → `ImageIO.write`) with direct JPEG metadata byte stripping. EXIF, APP, and COM segments are removed at byte level without touching pixel data, eliminating the most expensive operation in `hashPage()`.
- **File hashing 2-4x faster on large files** — Increased hash buffer from 8 KB to 64 KB, reducing system calls per file by 8x. Affects both `compute hash for files` and `compute hash for pages` tasks.
- **Faster hex encoding** — Replaced `joinToString` with pre-allocated `StringBuilder` and lookup table for hash-to-hex conversion, eliminating intermediate string allocations.
- **Thumbnail resize: skip redundant stream** — `resizeImageBuilder()` only calls `detectMediaType()` when the image is smaller than target size (early-out check). Previously created 3 streams from the same bytes every time.
- **Transparency check via alpha raster** — `containsTransparency()` now reads the alpha raster directly instead of calling `getRGB()` per pixel, which avoids color model conversion overhead on every pixel.
- **RAR entry analysis: stream reuse** — RAR and RAR5 extractors now use a single buffered stream with `mark()`/`reset()` for media type detection and dimension analysis, instead of creating two separate `inputStream()` instances per archive entry.
- **Library scan O(n²) → O(n)** — Converted 4 List-based `contains()` lookups to Set-based O(1) lookups in `LibraryContentLifecycle` (series URLs, book URLs, sidecar URLs, file hash matching). Significant speedup for large libraries during scans.
- **Book sorting O(n²) → O(n)** — `SeriesLifecycle.sortBooks()` now uses a Map for metadata lookup instead of nested `first{}` search, eliminating O(n²) matching when sorting books in a series.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix resume download 400 error** — Added missing "resume" action handler to `DownloadController`. Previously, clicking Resume in the UI returned HTTP 400 because only "cancel" and "retry" were handled. Resume now resets any failed/cancelled download back to PENDING without incrementing retry count.

### Changed
- **Chapter URL stored in ComicInfo.xml** — Chapter URLs are now stored in the `<Web>` tag of ComicInfo.xml inside each CBZ file, replacing the previous database-only tracking via `chapter_url` table. Download deduplication now reads URLs from existing CBZ files instead of the database, so deleting a CBZ file and re-running the download will correctly re-download it.
- **Auto-update old ComicInfo.xml with chapter URLs** — When a download runs and finds existing CBZ files without chapter URLs in their ComicInfo.xml, it automatically updates them with the correct MangaDex chapter URL. This backfills metadata for previously downloaded chapters.
- **Removed `chapterUrlRepository` dependency from `GalleryDlWrapper`** — Download deduplication no longer queries the `chapter_url` database table. CBZ files are the single source of truth for which chapters have been downloaded.

### Modified Files
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|

## [0.0.5] - 2026-02-20

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix cancelled downloads continuing to process** — `cancelDownload()` and `deleteDownload()` now immediately kill the gallery-dl subprocess via `Process.destroyForcibly()`. Previously, cancellation was only checked inside the progress callback, allowing the subprocess to keep running between chapters.
- **Fix duplicate downloads every follow check** — Follow check now uses the new `ChapterChecker` service which compares MangaDex aggregate chapter counts against downloaded chapters (DB + filesystem). Downloads are only created when new chapters are actually detected, eliminating duplicate entries.
- **Remove `.chapter-urls.json` system** — The `.chapter-urls.json` file could contain entries for chapters that weren't fully downloaded (saved before CBZ was finalized). Duplicate detection now relies solely on the `chapter_url` database table and filesystem CBZ checks, which are both reliable. Existing `.chapter-urls.json` files are cleaned up during library scans.

### New Features
- **Fast parallel chapter checking** — New `ChapterChecker` service checks all followed manga for new chapters using the MangaDex aggregate endpoint (`/manga/{id}/aggregate`). Runs 5 concurrent checks, reducing check time for 200 manga from 6+ hours to under a minute.
- **Chapter naming with title** — Downloaded chapters are now named `Ch. 001 - Chapter Title.cbz` instead of `c001.cbz`. Falls back to `Ch. 001.cbz` when no title is available.
- **Multi-group scanlation support** — Same chapter from different scanlation groups is now downloaded separately. Group name is included in the gallery-dl directory pattern (`c{chapter} [{group}]`) to prevent file collisions. When multiple groups exist for the same chapter number, the CBZ filename includes the group name: `Ch. 001 - Title [GroupName].cbz`.
- **Check-new API endpoints** — `POST /api/v1/downloads/check-new` triggers a chapter check and queues downloads for manga with new chapters. `POST /api/v1/downloads/check-only` runs the check without queuing.
- **Cancellation check between chapters** — Download cancellation is now checked between each chapter download in addition to the progress callback, ensuring faster response to cancel requests.
- **Process tracking** — Active download processes are tracked via `ActiveDownload` data class, enabling immediate subprocess termination on cancel/delete.

### Performance
- **MangaDex aggregate endpoint** — Uses `/manga/{id}/aggregate` for quick chapter count comparison instead of the full `/manga/{id}/feed` endpoint. Much faster for checking if new chapters exist.
- **5-concurrent chapter checking** — Parallel checking with semaphore-based concurrency control, staying within MangaDex rate limits (~5 req/s).
- **Skip up-to-date manga** — Manga where the aggregate chapter count matches the downloaded count are skipped entirely, no download entry created.

### Technical Details

#### New Service
- `ChapterChecker` — Fast parallel chapter checking using MangaDex aggregate endpoint, replaces sequential `processFollowList()`

#### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/downloads/check-new` — Check for new chapters and queue downloads
- `POST /api/v1/downloads/check-only` — Check for new chapters without queuing

#### Modified Files
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `DownloadExecutor.kt` | `ActiveDownload` data class, process tracking, subprocess killing on cancel/delete |
| `GalleryDlWrapper.kt` | Removed `.chapter-urls.json` system, added `isCancelled`/`onProcessStarted` params, new chapter naming, multi-group directory pattern, `extractMangaDexId` moved to companion object |
| `ChapterUrlImporter.kt` | Gutted — now only cleans up legacy `.chapter-urls.json` files |
| `DownloadScheduler.kt` | Uses `ChapterChecker` instead of `processFollowList()` |
| `DownloadController.kt` | Added `check-new` and `check-only` endpoints |
| `DownloadDto.kt` | Added `ChapterCheckResultDto` and `ChapterCheckSummaryDto` |

## [0.0.4] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- `DELETE /api/v1/downloads/clear/pending` endpoint to clear pending downloads
- `isUrlAlreadyQueued()` public method on DownloadExecutor
- `existsBySourceUrlAndStatusIn()` on DownloadQueueRepository for status-aware duplicate checking
- 44+ new locale/translation files (ar, bg, ca, cs, da, el, eo, fa, fi, gl, he, hr, hu, id, ja, ko, nb, sl, th, ta, ti, tr, uk, vi, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, and more)
- Docker image reference and Docker Compose example in README
- `publisher` field in generated series.json for better metadata compatibility

### Fixed
- **Follow list duplicate prevention** — now includes COMPLETED status in addition to PENDING/DOWNLOADING, preventing re-queuing of already downloaded manga
- **Follow config duplicate check** — `processFollowConfigNow` checks for existing queue entries before adding URLs
- **Null safety in Mylar metadata** — status field mapping now handles null values correctly

### Improved
- **Shortest title selection** — when the English title exceeds 80 characters, automatically uses the shortest available English title from both main and alternative titles
- **Better cancellation handling** — dedicated `cancelledIds` tracking set, cancellation checked before processing starts and during progress callbacks
- **Improved filename sanitization** — enhanced regex removes all invalid Windows filename characters, trims trailing dots

### Changed
- Kotlin 2.2.0 → 2.2.21
- ktlint plugin 13.0.0 → 13.1.0
- ben-manes versions plugin 0.52.0 → 0.53.0
